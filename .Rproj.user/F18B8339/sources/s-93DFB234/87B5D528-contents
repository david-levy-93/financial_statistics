# financial_statistics
A modern portfolio theory and investment analysis playground.

The workflow of this repository will roughly follow Dr. Nicolas Christou's curriculum for his UCLA course "Statistical Models in Finance."

Further exploration of course topics and any additional items of interest will be recorded in this repository as well, and will likely not be designated as deviating from the curriculum. All code included is original and authored by David Levy.
